# BASeTris

A Tetris Engine/Clone built in C#.

This utilizes Another of my libraries, [Elementizer](https://github.com/BCProgramming/Elementizer).

Currently it would require fetching/pulling that repository manually and fixing the project association. I plan to fix that eventually. Hopefully This will not stand as it does for the next 5 years or I'll
feel rather silly.
