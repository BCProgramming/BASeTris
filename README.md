# BASeTris

A Tetris Engine/Clone built in C#.

Contains Handlers for Tetris, Dr. Mario, Tetris Attack, Columns, and a number of variants.

This project makes use of some of my other libraries: [BCRendering](https://github.com/BCProgramming/BCRendering), [Elementizer](https://github.com/BCProgramming/Elementizer), and [BASeScores](https://github.com/BCProgramming/BASeScores).

I have a Jenkins CI configured which will upload new versions as needed every two days. The latest build's installer can be directly accessed via [this](https://bc-programming.com/blogs/?smd_process_download=1&download_id=2717) URL.
